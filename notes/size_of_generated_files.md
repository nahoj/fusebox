### User Input

it's good. there's an issue with size. when I cat a generated html file (@[/home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/scripts/markdown-to-html.jsh:L14-L15] ), it gets cut short , i assume because the getattr size is the one of the .md.
However, if I go anywhere near the mount point in Dolphin, it will gettattr what's in it, which would be a problem if it ran all transforms at once for naught (though I think I'd rather that in the absolute).
Is there any go-between?

### Planner Response

I'll update [ContentViewFS.getattr()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:8:4-17:5) to compute the transformed size on-demand when first requested, so tools like cat don't truncate. As a safeguard, I'll also invalidate the cached size on write/truncate passthroughs to avoid stale sizes. Then I'll run tests.

### Planner Response

## Cause
- cat truncation happens because [getattr](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:66:4-82:5) returned the source [.md](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/driven/LocalFS.java:282:4-287:5) size before open, so kernel readahead stops early.
- File managers (e.g., Dolphin) call [getattr](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:66:4-82:5) for many entries, so eagerly running heavy transforms there can be costly.

## Go-between implemented
In [ContentViewFS.getattr()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:66:4-82:5) we now balance correctness and cost:

- For matching non-directories:
    - If cached size exists, return it.
    - If file is small (<= 512 KiB): compute transformed bytes once and cache exact size.
    - If large: avoid heavy transform on getattr; return an over-estimate (2x + 4 KiB) to prevent truncation.
- On [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/api/FuseboxFS.java:104:4-106:5): compute exact transformed content and size, cache them.
- On passthrough [write()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:137:4-143:5)/[truncate()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/api/FuseboxFS.java:116:4-118:5): invalidate cached size so it’s recomputed next time.
- On [release()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/driven/LocalFS.java:390:4-395:5) of last transformed handle: clear cached size for that path.

    - [getattr()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:66:4-82:5) now computes size on-demand with a size threshold and over-estimation.
    - [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/api/FuseboxFS.java:104:4-106:5) fills `openContent`, `renderedSizeByPath`, and per-path counters.
    - [write()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:137:4-143:5)/[truncate()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/api/FuseboxFS.java:116:4-118:5) remove `renderedSizeByPath` entries for affected paths.
    - [release()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/driven/LocalFS.java:390:4-395:5) removes cached size after last handle closes.

## Why this helps
- cat and similar tools won’t truncate: pre-open size is never smaller than the true transformed size.
- Dolphin can traverse directories without forcing all transforms:
    - Small files: exact size computed once on getattr.
    - Large files: we avoid expensive transforms during listing; exact size is computed on first open.

## Notes
- You can change the heuristic easily:
    - Always exact on getattr: set threshold high or remove the over-estimate branch.
    - Always avoid compute on getattr: always use over-estimate (still safe for cat).
- Tests were updated and pass:
    - Pre-open size is now asserted to be ≥ transformed size.
    - After open, size equals transformed size.

## Optional tweaks
- Make the eager-size threshold configurable (env/system property or a constructor param).
- Add a max cache TTL if directory views are long-lived and source files change often.

## Status
Implemented the heuristic in [ContentViewFS](cci:2://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:36:0-178:1), added invalidations, and verified with unit tests. You should be able to cat the generated `.html` without truncation, while Dolphin won’t trigger heavy transforms for large files.

### User Input

could getattr just not return a size?

*Running MCP tool*

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

## Short answer
No. In FUSE, getattr must return a size (st_size). There isn’t a “no size”/unknown value the kernel will accept for regular files. If you return 0 or the source size, tools like cat can truncate or stop early.

## Practical options
- __Direct I/O (best if supported)__  
  In FUSE, setting FOPEN_DIRECT_IO in open() tells the kernel to bypass page cache and readahead, so clients won’t rely on st_size. In jfuse this typically means setting a flag on [FileInfo](cci:2://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:11:0-39:1) during [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:107:4-132:5) for transformed paths. If jfuse exposes this (e.g. via [fi.setFlags(...)](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:45:4-47:5)), we can enable it for transformed handles. Trade-off: less caching/perf, but accurate streaming reads without needing exact size in getattr.

- __Heuristic we implemented (safe default)__  
  In [ContentViewFS.getattr()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:64:4-72:5):
    - Small files: compute transformed bytes and return the exact size.
    - Large files: return an over-estimate (2x + 4KiB) to avoid truncation, compute exact size/content on [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:107:4-132:5).
    - Invalidate cached size on [write()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:137:4-143:5)/[truncate()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:144:4-150:5) passthrough.  
      Result: cat won’t truncate, Dolphin won’t force heavy transforms for big files.

- __Always eager compute (simple, heavier)__  
  Always compute transformed size on getattr for matching files. This avoids over-estimation but can be expensive when file managers stat lots of entries.

- __Always over-estimate (cheapest getattr)__  
  Never compute on getattr, always over-estimate and refine after [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:107:4-132:5). Users will see “wrong” sizes in file managers until the first open.

## Recommendation
- If jfuse lets us set FUSE open flags, enable __direct I/O__ for transformed handles in [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:107:4-132:5); then we can safely keep getattr cheap and still avoid truncation.
- Otherwise, keep the current heuristic or switch to “always over-estimate” if you prefer zero-cost getattr for large trees.

If you want, I can try wiring direct I/O for transformed opens in [ContentViewFS.open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:107:4-132:5) (depends on jfuse’s [FileInfo](cci:2://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:11:0-39:1) flags support).

### User Input

what happens when getattr returns a higher size before open btw?
what if i returned 1MB size for my generated htmls?

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

## Short answer
- Returning a larger st_size in getattr is generally safe for reads: the kernel will issue read requests up to that size, but as soon as your read() returns 0 at the real end, the reader (e.g., cat) stops. No truncation risk.
- The downsides are extra read calls, inaccurate sizes in UIs, and potential issues for programs that preallocate or mmap based on st_size.

## What actually happens
- If st_size is bigger than real:
    - The kernel may readahead beyond the real content. Your [read()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:141:4-151:5) should return 0 once `offset >= transformedLength`. The reader stops there.
    - cat/less: will just do a couple of extra reads and finish. No hang or truncation.
    - cp/backup tools: some may preallocate the destination to st_size. If they don’t shrink at EOF, you can end up with an over-sized or padded destination file (many tools do shrink, but it’s tool-dependent).
    - mmap users: they can map up to st_size. Accessing pages beyond the real data may fault unexpectedly (worst case SIGBUS) depending on how the VFS and FUSE back those pages. Over-reporting is riskier for mmapped workloads.

## If you “just return 1 MiB”
- cat works fine (no truncation), but:
    - Directory listings show bogus sizes.
    - cp/rsync may preallocate 1 MiB per file (wasteful).
    - mmap-heavy apps can be unhappy.
    - You’ll do needless readahead and extra read() calls.

## Recommended approaches
- Keep the hybrid we implemented in [ContentViewFS.getattr()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/RenamedFS.java:7:4-12:5):
    - Small files: compute exact transformed size.
    - Large files: over-estimate (to avoid truncation), refine to exact on open.
    - Invalidate cached size on write/truncate.
- If you want zero-cost getattr always: always over-estimate (safe for cat, less correct for tools/UI).
- If jfuse supports it, consider enabling direct I/O on transformed opens so clients don’t lean on st_size (trade-off: less caching/perf, but simpler semantics).

If you want, I can add a config toggle to switch among:
- AlwaysExactOnGetattr
- Heuristic (current)
- AlwaysOverestimate (with a configurable default like 1 MiB cap or factor).

### User Input

have a look for direct IO, otherwise write a terse/casual issue i could post to jfuse

*Grep searched codebase*

### Planner Response

# Findings
- __No direct I/O flags found in this codebase__: I couldn’t find any `FOPEN_*`, `DIRECT_IO`, or similar constants/usages. Only [FileInfo.getFlags()/setFlags(int)](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:27:4-30:5) are present (e.g., [eu.nahoj.fusebox.common.util.SimpleFileInfo](cci:2://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:11:0-34:1)), but there are no exported constants in this repo to set FUSE open flags.
- __jfuse examples__ (`org.cryptomator.jfuse.examples.AbstractMirrorFileSystem`) don’t show a way to enable direct I/O either.

Conclusion: From what’s visible here, jfuse doesn’t expose a clear way to set FUSE’s `FOPEN_DIRECT_IO` (or `keep_cache`, `nonseekable`) via [FileInfo](cci:2://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:11:0-34:1) today, at least not with documented constants in this project.

# Terse issue draft for jfuse
Title: Expose direct I/O/open flags for streaming/transformed files

Hi! I’m building a content-transforming FS on top of jfuse (e.g., render Markdown to HTML on the fly). For many clients (cat, cp, file managers), st_size from getattr drives kernel readahead. When the transformed size is unknown/expensive at getattr time, we either:
- Over-estimate st_size to avoid truncation (inaccurate sizes, extra reads), or
- Eagerly compute transformed bytes on getattr (expensive when a file manager stats directories).

In libfuse, a common solution is to set FOPEN_DIRECT_IO (and sometimes KEEP_CACHE/NONSEEKABLE) on open() for such handles, so clients don’t rely on st_size/page cache semantics.

Ask:
- Does jfuse currently expose a way to set FUSE open flags (e.g., direct_io/keep_cache/nonseekable) on a [FileInfo](cci:2://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:11:0-34:1) returned from [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:94:4-119:5)?
- If not, could jfuse provide:
    - a type-safe constants enum (e.g., FileInfoFlags.FOPEN_DIRECT_IO), or
    - dedicated setters (e.g., `FileInfo.setDirectIO(true)`, `setKeepCache(true)`, etc.)?
- Minimal desired usage:
  ```java
  public void open(String path, FileInfo fi) {
      if (isTransformed(path)) {
          fi.setFlags(fi.getFlags() | FileInfoFlags.FOPEN_DIRECT_IO);
      }
      // ...
  }
  ```
This would let us stream transformed content without accurate st_size in getattr and without heavy upfront transforms.

If there’s already a supported way to do this in jfuse, pointers to the API/docs would be much appreciated. Thanks!

# Recommendation
- If jfuse confirms/introduces direct I/O flags: set them for transformed handles in [ContentViewFS.open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:94:4-119:5).
- Until then, the heuristic we added in [ContentViewFS.getattr()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:63:4-71:5) is a reasonable compromise:
    - Small files: compute exact transformed size on getattr.
    - Large files: over-estimate to avoid truncation; compute exact on open.
    - Invalidate cached size on writes/truncates.

Summary: I checked the codebase; no direct I/O flag access is apparent. Use the above issue text to ask jfuse to expose/set FUSE open flags.

### User Input

in libfuse, open() can change the same set of flags (as an int) that it receives?

### Planner Response

- Short answer: No. In libfuse, your open() handler can’t change the POSIX O_* flags the kernel passed (O_RDONLY/WRONLY/RDWR, O_APPEND, O_TRUNC, etc.). Those are inputs describing the caller’s intent.

- What you can change in open():
    - You set properties on fuse_file_info that affect kernel behavior for that handle, notably:
        - direct_io: disable page cache and readahead for the file.
        - keep_cache: keep cache across open/close.
        - nonseekable: inform that lseek isn’t meaningful.
        - fh: your file handle.
    - In the low-level protocol these map to FOPEN_* bits in the reply (FOPEN_DIRECT_IO, FOPEN_KEEP_CACHE, FOPEN_NONSEEKABLE). They are distinct from the O_* flags you received.

- Mapping to your code/jfuse:
    - [FileInfo.getOpenFlags()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:25:4-27:5) (Set<StandardOpenOption>) represents the caller’s O_* flags. These are read-only for you to inspect.
    - [FileInfo.getFlags()/setFlags(int)](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:41:4-43:5) would be the place to set FOPEN_* style bits if jfuse exposed them, but I didn’t find typed constants in this repo. Hence the suggestion to jfuse to expose direct I/O/keep_cache flags explicitly.

So: you can’t rewrite O_TRUNC/O_APPEND/etc. in open(); you can only set per-handle FUSE open flags (direct_io/keep_cache/nonseekable) and your own fh.

### User Input

for my use case, you'd recommend all 3 flags?

### Planner Response

## Recommendation per flag (for transformed, read-only views)

- __direct_io__: Yes.
    - Avoids kernel page cache/readahead depending on st_size.
    - Prevents truncation issues when size is unknown at getattr.
    - Trade-off: less caching and possibly slower sequential reads; mmap may not behave as expected.

- __keep_cache__: It depends.
    - Set to true if the transformed content is stable across opens and you want perf from client-side cache.
    - Set to false if source files can change outside your FS (or transforms vary) to avoid stale data.
    - If you also use direct_io, keep_cache is typically ignored; caching semantics vary by kernel/libfuse.

- __nonseekable__: Usually no.
    - Only set if your transformed stream cannot support random-access reads (seeks or out-of-order read offsets).
    - Your current [ContentViewFS](cci:2://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/transform/ContentViewFS.java:36:0-178:1) serves arbitrary offsets from an in-memory byte array, so it is seekable. Setting nonseekable would unnecessarily constrain clients (e.g., tools that jump around).

## Summary
- Use: direct_io = true; keep_cache = case-by-case; nonseekable = false (for your current implementation).
- If jfuse exposes these flags, set them only for transformed handles in [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/driven/LocalFS.java:0:4-3:5); leave passthrough files untouched.

If you want, I can sketch the exact [open()](cci:1://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/driven/LocalFS.java:0:4-3:5) change once jfuse documents how to set these flags on [FileInfo](cci:2://file:///home/jg/perso/soft/fusebox/src/main/java/eu/nahoj/fusebox/util/SimpleFileInfo.java:11:0-48:1).
